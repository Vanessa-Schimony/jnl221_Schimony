			<p> <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Food-Service-Establishment-Last-Inspection/cnih-y5dw/about_data" target="_blank"> number of failed inspections in Syracuse, Ny vs Clay, Ny </a> </p>

			<p> This hypothesis: Resaurants in Syracuse in 2025 failed inspection more often than restaurants in Clay did in that same year. 

			I think this is a good hypothesis because it makes a claim that can be either proved or disproved with data and other information, while also having the info linked here on the page, too. </p>
