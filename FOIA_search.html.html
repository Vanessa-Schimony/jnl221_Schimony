			<p>I think that the growing homeless population is a story that documentation could provide some seriously important content on. Based off some of the recent documents I’ve located, the numbers speak for themselves. Through materials posted by the Housing and Homeless Coalition of Central New York, it was found that the homeless rate of people in central New York has increased 50% in the past five years. The website also provides plenty of charts and details with specifics on the homeless populations’ ages, genders, racial stats etc. In addition, an online living calculator for Syracuse, NY could also provide for an in-depth look behind the growing homeless population. As homeless populations increases, so does the cost of living, making homelessness an ongoing issue that only will continue until more affordable housing is provided in Syracuse. </p>
