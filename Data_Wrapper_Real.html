			<h1>Vanessa Schimony's Data Report</h1>
			<h4>Syracuse University, Fall 2025</h4>
		</div>

		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>Philadelphia Police Officers make almost four times what they made five years ago. Tha annual salary of Phildadelphia Police Officers has grown from $22,000 to $78,000 since 2019. </p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="Schimony_Original_Data_Sketch.jpg" alt="Annual Salary of PPD workers" height="300px" width="400px">
		

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="vanessas_map.png" alt="cleaner graph of salary trends among PPD officers" height="400px" width="500px">

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>I did not get much feedback on my DataViz chart, however, I feel that I displayed my information as cleanly and accurately as possible. Considering this is a graph talking about change over time in terms of salary, I think a line graph made the most sense for this. </p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="Philadelphia Police Officers make nearly 4x more in their annual salary than they did six years ago" aria-label="Line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-9OQQZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9OQQZ/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="430" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>Not much was changed from my original Data Wrapper chart other than my annotation near the highlighted aspect of the chart to give more context. I also made the color a little bit darker of a shade of green to have it stick out more. However, other than that, nothing else was changed. </p>
