			<p>Public dataset #1
				<a href="https://data.syr.gov/datasets/eab16ff8bdda4c53806b4d07a6ab31ea_0/explore?location=0.072161%2C-76.137882%2C0.00" > crime rates in Syracuse

How is this data organized and collected? The data is collected in an Excel sheet. Each column holds a different aspect of information. The data set is for crime in 2022 in Syracuse (part 2, the information was too big to put the entire year’s worth of crime stats in one Excel sheet). There’s a column for the date, the time the crime happened, the type of crime it was, the address of the offense, and quality of life. 

Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?
Crime involves proximity, impact and timeliness, three critical factors to what makes something newsworthy. Aside from the crime itself taking place, I think this information could be used to determine what crimes are most likely to take place in certain areas of Syracuse, or maybe just in general overall. These documents are good because you can compare current crime trends while looking at the trends from previous years, and see how often certain types of crime are increasing or decreasing over the years. A good audience for this would be the SU student body, as well as faculty and employees, and the overall Syracuse community.
What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?
Someone who experiences crime in Syracuse is more likely to experience criminal mischief or simple assault than other crimes.

<p> Public dataset #2
	<a href="https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/indexcrimes/county_totals.html" > crime rates in Onondaga
(then click onondaga)

How is this data organized and collected? The data is organized into a chart based on Onondaga County crime rates over the years (not the most recent, but gives us information on all crime in Onondaga County from 2017-2021). The dataset goes into detail about how many times a specific crime happened in each town in Onondaga County during a specific year. The dataset is split into two sections: violence crime and property crime. It also provides overall totals with each specific crime. 

Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?
Again, crime involves impact, proximity, and timeliness, three very critical aspects to what makes an event newsworthy. Crime is a consistent issue in most cities, also making it important. The SU student body, SU employees, staff, and the general population of Onondaga County would make for a good audience if there was for a story to be written on this. 

What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?
Jordan, New York is the safest section of Onondaga County.
