			<h1>VANESSA SCHIMONY</h1>
			<h4>Syracuse University, Fall 2025</h4>

		<section>
			<p>VANESSA SCHIMONY IS A STUDENT AT SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY. SHE IS A BROADCAST JOURNALSIM MAJOR WITH A FASHION DESIGN MINOR. SHE IS FROM OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA.

		<p>I think it was really remarkable how they brought up the fact that the UK is starting to adapt to a Chinese-similar surveillance system with facial recognition on lasers and cameras. I actually did not even know that that was a thing until now. I think that (to a certain extent), that does invade personal privacy, but it is incredible that technology exists that can even do that. A quote that caught me off guard was when they brought up the fact that “117 million people in the U.S. have their face registered in some form of a network”, and it makes a lot of sense when you think of large tech companies like Instagram and such. 
</p>
<p>A lot of how I have seen A.I. used in social media is for comedic reels and corrupt political videos, at least in my algorithm. In the documentary, it talks about how the internet is evolving more and more, and how your algorithm will shift sometimes strictly just based on what you say, and not even from opening any apps or seeing anything (Alexa, etc). I also did not think of how the people who you notice like certain content also affect your algorithm. 
</p>

<p>I notice that a lot of the data sets have to do with robots and self driving cars, so my two questions would be: 

How often do these self-driving mobiles tend to cause casualties?
What tends to be the reason these vehicles tend to mechanically keep malfunctioning?

HYPOTHESIS: If these robot-generated mechanisms tend to cause more harm than good, than are they hypothetically worth trying to develop?
